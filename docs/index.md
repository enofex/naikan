*Naikan* is a powerful inventory management tool for developer teams, that allows organizations to keep track of critical
information related to their software projects. It enables users to manage their projects' essential
details, including project name, organization, team, contacts, developers, integrations, licenses,
deployments, environments, and technologies used. The tool can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to
automatically push data for new projects and updates.

## Automatic CI/CD Integration for Pushing Project Information to Naikan

By integrating the CI/CD pipeline with Naikan, project information can be seamlessly transferred,
ensuring up-to-date and accurate data for
monitoring and analysis purposes.

## Workflow Steps

* **Naikan Maven Plugin Configuration**: Begin by configuring the Maven Naikan Plugin within your project's Maven POM file. This Plugin will extract all information automatically and created a JSON file you can push to Naikan. 

* **JSON File Configuration (Optional)**: Create a JSON file that contains the necessary project information you want to override from the generated file created by the Naikan Maven Plugin.The JSON file should follow a predefined structure to ensure compatibility with Naikan's data
  requirements.
  
* **Custom Provider (Optional)**: One of the standout features of the Naikan Maven Plugin is its support for custom providers. Developers have the freedom to define their own data providers, allowing for tailored integration. This extensibility enables the plugin to adapt to the unique needs and structures of different projects. Additionally, the plugin offers the capability to fine-tune the order in which these custom providers are employed. 


* **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**: Configure a CI/CD pipeline using your preferred tool (e.g., Jenkins,
  GitLab CI/CD, Bamboo, Travis CI). Define the necessary pipeline stages and steps to ensure the
  successful execution of the workflow.
  Ensure that the pipeline has access to the JSON file containing the project information.

* **Push to Naikan**: Add a dedicated stage in the CI/CD pipeline to push the project information to
  Naikan.
  Utilize the appropriate Naikan API endpoint to transfer the JSON file's contents automatically.
  Ensure that the pipeline has the necessary authentication tokens to access Naikan
  securely.
